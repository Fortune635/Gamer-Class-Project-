## 📘 Overview
This Python program demonstrates **polymorphism**, one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
It defines a `Vehicle` base class and several subclasses (`Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat`) that implement the same method `move()` differently.

---

## 🧩 Features
- Shows how the same method name can behave differently for different objects.  
- Demonstrates the power of **inheritance** and **method overriding**.  
- Simple and beginner-friendly example for understanding **OOP polymorphism**.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
By completing this activity, you will learn:
- How polymorphism works in Python classes  
- How to override methods in subclasses  
- How to call the same method across different objects dynamically

## 🖥️ Example Output
```text
🚗 The car is driving on the road.
✈️ The plane is flying in the sky.
⛵ The boat is sailing on the water.
