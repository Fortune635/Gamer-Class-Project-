## 📘 Overview
This Python program demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles by creating a `Gamer` class and an inherited `ProGamer` class.  
It showcases **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism** in a fun and interactive way.

---

## 🧩 Features
- Defines a **Gamer** class with attributes and methods that describe a player.  
- Uses a **constructor (`__init__`)** to initialize each object with unique values.  
- Implements **encapsulation** using a private attribute (`__score`).  
- Demonstrates **inheritance** and **polymorphism** through the `ProGamer` subclass.  
- Includes methods to:
  - Play a game  
  - Update and retrieve scores  
  - Participate in tournaments
